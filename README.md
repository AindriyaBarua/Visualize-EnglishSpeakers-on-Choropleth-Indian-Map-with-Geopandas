# Visualize-EnglishSpeakers-on-Indian-Map-with-Geopandas

This python code uses Geopandas to plot the results from a survey conducted by a large, nationally representative sample survey conducted by Lok Foundation and Oxford University, administered by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy in 2019.  
A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which a set of pre-defined areas is colored or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area, such as population density or per-capita income.
Choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a variable varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region.
The project generates a chloropleth map representing the number of English speakers in each state.
